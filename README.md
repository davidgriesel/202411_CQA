# Coffee Quality
## Overview
The quality of coffee is influenced by various factors throughout its production process such as origin, variety, processing, and brewing methods. Assessing coffee quality involves both objective and subjective solutions, conducted through standardised procedures. Understanding these intricate dynamics is essential for producers aiming to enhance their crops and for consumers seeking to appreciate the nuances of different coffees.

## Goals
Analyse coffee quality across countries, explore predictive relationships between quality measures, and examine the link between quality scores and demand.

## Scope
The analysis covers beans harvested worldwide between 2009 and 2018.

## Key Questions
1. Which countries produce the best coffee?
2. Can certain measures be used to predict the scores of others?
3. Is there a higher demand for coffee with better quality scores?

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data sourcing and preparation: Sourcing and preparing open source data for analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Using Python, visualising relationships, and developing hypotheses based on data patterns.
- Geospatial analysis: Integrating and analysing spatial data using shape files and Python to create Choropleth maps.
- Machine learning (Supervised and unsupervised: Applying regression techniques for predictive analysis and k-means clustering for pattern discovery.
- Time-series analysis: Analysing temporal data through decomposition, stationarity tests, and transformations to enable predictive modelling.
- Data visualisation and Storytelling: Effectively communicating insights through Tableau dashboards and Python visualisations, ensuring audience engagement and clarity.

## Tools
- Python
- Tableau

## Data
Two datasets from the Coffee Quality Institute was used in the analysis:

1. Coffee Quality with Locations of Origin – Quality scores of coffee beans by country.
2. Average Production Per Year – Consumption, import, export, and production metrics over time.
